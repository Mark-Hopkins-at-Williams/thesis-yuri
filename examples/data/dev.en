Just as we, in my home country, have the groundwater that we want to look after, and that I choose to use as an example here, there are, of course, other countries with various other environmental and health-related matters that they would like to protect and the EU must never force a country to lower its level of protection.
I would like to stress one final thing which I mentioned earlier in my introductory speech: if any employees are laid off - and it has been mentioned in the debate here that General Motors is considering laying off around 8 000 to 10 000 employees - then the impact of this affair will undoubtedly reach beyond Antwerp.
Whereas, for example, in Sweden, a man who does not share the parental leave is regarded by society as a poor father, in the countries of southern Europe, the reverse is true: fathers are coerced by employers and work colleagues into not taking the leave to which they are legally entitled.
However, there are positive aspects in the report, which we support, particularly with regard to meeting the needs of researchers, their rights in terms of working and social security conditions, reunification of families, rights of female researchers and access for young researchers, and the call for increased funding for research and the involvement of a greater number of researchers.
The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer.

As was the case in 2004, the Council Presidency will be invited to choose a candidate from the main European Parliamentary group, to hold this important position, and it will then fall to our Parliament on 15 July to voice its opinion on this choice, which will constitute one of the first major political actions of the new parliamentary term.
I also believe that the call on the Commission to amend the necessary directives in order to ban the locating of landfills in protected natural areas, natural parks, Natura 2000 sites and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation heritage areas, or the expansion of existing ones into such areas, is of great benefit.

Thus I reject this contrivance of European citizenship, which of course is a complement to the ongoing efforts to be advanced by the Lisbon Treaty to build the statehood of the EU and thus this notion that we all have to be, whether we like it or not, want it or not, EU citizens first and foremost.
The second thing I would like to say is that there is no point in beating about the bush: I am pleased that the Commissioner is announcing welcome initiatives on transparency and openness, but the fact remains that the Commission's proposal excludes documents that are currently open and transparent from the scope of this legislation.
Nevertheless, in order to operate effectively in the interests of EU citizens, the Commission should give MEPs observer status at all international conferences and, where possible, facilitate our presence at other significant meetings to an even greater extent, as well as inform Parliament of the negotiating positions adopted by the Commission at such meetings and conferences.

However, there will be, for once, someone credible in government, in contrast with the current Portuguese Government, which had to table four stability and growth programmes, and which is constantly seeking new solutions without being able to give the markets a credible response; to give a response that serves the interests of Portugal and of Europe.
The assumption that women must be able to achieve easier abortions in order to recover their right to sexual freedom not only runs counter to general lay morals, but also contradicts the principles enshrined in recital Z, which states that the promotion of 'higher birth rates to meet future requirements' is central to the European action.
The overwhelming expectation is that Parliament's evaluation concurs with the positive position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and that the citizens of both countries, Bulgaria and Romania, feel that their institutions have done what they need to do and that the light to proceed down 'Schengen Road' is already green.
Having said this, there are a series of problems to resolve before electric cars can be fully efficient, and the task that we now have in front of us is to focus on seeing how we can resolve these problems as soon as possible so that electric cars can also become part of the whole project of having more sustainable and efficient energy consumption.
Eight of the fourteen countries are tax havens and yet we signed a free trade agreement with those countries, the result of which will be to institute free trade and the liberalisation of financial services, the consequence of which will be that toxic credits and illicit money can freely flow from those tax havens into the European Union.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say from the outset, to save time, that I agree in essence with the illustration given by Mrs Lulling, who served as rapporteur for the main committee on this report.
I support the report's proposal that, in order to reduce these inequalities and streamline the European integration process for all Member States, we need to reduce the period required for funding approval and cut red tape and all the rules and procedures along with it, which needlessly hinder rather than help the European Union's cohesion policy.
We therefore encourage the Commission to act on Parliament's request for it to conduct an impact assessment study and, in the event that the assessment demonstrates a destabilising effect on the EU's fish processing and canning industry, for it to initiate the procedure leading to suspension of the exceptional arrangements in this agreement regarding rules of origin.
It is unfortunate that indifference is particularly great in Central and Eastern European countries, the roots of which is once again to be sought in the inadequacy of information, but another contributing factor is that the pace of catching up after the great wave of enlargement has slowed down and caused disappointment.
I consider that, in order to achieve this, we need to create a user-friendly, flexible, clear legislative act which, where feasible, is binding on the Member States and which will facilitate and provide security of law to contracting parties, without interfering in national laws and without affecting the financially weaker.
The proposal for revision of the Eurovignette Directive, which is at issue here, is aimed at introducing the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport, allowing the Member States to include the cost of noise and air pollution in national tolls, which means the levying of yet another charge on heavy goods vehicles.
So the solution really is, I think, in the multi-point plan suggested by my colleague, Mr Busuttil, particularly to ensure that repatriation takes place when it is proper and safe to do so and, of course, also to send back asylum seekers who are not deserving of that status within the European Union.
I abstained, firstly because Amendment 13, which considers nuclear energy to be an important factor in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, was approved and, secondly, because Amendment 3 by my group, calling for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 and 95% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels, was rejected.
However, there is no doubt that the European Union has been very clear on this matter and has always been against these detention centres, whether they be known detention centres such as Guantánamo, or allegedly secret ones, and we have always been very open in the European Union to finding out the facts as to whether the latter really exist.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank the older members of Parliament - as this is my first term of office - and my fellow members Mr Hughes and Mrs Lynne and the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, because I have come in on the tail end of work on an issue which, in a way, also concerns me personally.
I believe we share the view that the result of Copenhagen falls badly short of our goal of an ambitious and legally binding agreement, which would be necessary to limit climate change to below 2° C. This is extremely disappointing for all of us who have fought for years and years for concrete policy decisions to reverse climate change.
The government's achievements in this area have been significant: the country has approved a 5% quota of public offices reserved for minorities, religious festivals for minorities have been made official, minorities are to have their own special day of celebration on 11 August, and the Senate is planning the same 5% quota for that institution.
That very respect for compliance with international humanitarian law and the norms of international human rights law by both parties in the conflict would be a basic precondition in the Middle Eastern conflict for discernible progress in the peace process, which could now suffer a serious setback, once again, as a result of Israel's planned settlement construction.
(SK) Madam President, we always have a number of problematic issues on hand for negotiations with Russia, such as the standard of civil rights, the nonsensical ban on imports of vegetables from the EU, the anti-missile shield located in the EU, or the problematic involvement of Russia in many former Soviet republics.
At the same time, European Union countries must also be aware that it is in their interest for Romania and Bulgaria to join Schengen because they will be able to make their own contribution to the security of all Member States and extend the Schengen area, which is set to strengthen the integration process within the European Union and the common area of freedom, security and justice.
in writing. - Labour MEPs welcome this annual review of the European Security Strategy and Common Security and Defence Policy, especially in the light of the changes brought about by the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, and, in this regard, especially welcome the role of High Representative, Baroness Cathy Ashton, in the associated debate in Parliament.
Madam President, Mrs Vălean, honourable Members, the gas crisis at the beginning of last year showed us how important it is for Europe to have an energy infrastructure in place that not only promotes the functioning of the internal market, but that also enables solidarity between the Member States and the regions affected in the event of a crisis.
Thanks to the Göncz report on micro-credit and the controversy that surrounded the financing of this project, I went to see what this famous Progress programme - which the left is so adamant should not be deprived of a single cent for the financing of micro-enterprises and individual initiatives - is all about.
However, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government.
We must acknowledge here that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved, because it is only through the parliaments that the majority of regulations can be suitably adapted, and that this process and the proposals in connection with the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of paramount importance.
in writing. - (DE) A healthy farming sector - and I am not talking here about agro-industrial factories, but rather about small-scale family farms - provides a guarantee of the continued existence of rural culture, nature and our cultural landscape, as well as being essential to securing the supply of food for our population.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following observation: it is most surprising that, while growth indicators for Albania are constantly rising, with growth exceeding 2% in 2010, in the midst of global economic instability, and expected to reach 3% in 2011, social tension is, nonetheless, getting worse rather than better.
This text marks a major step forward in establishing a common European asylum system (CEAS) by 2012, thereby putting an end to the intolerable situation whereby, depending on the European country in which an asylum seeker applies for protection, his or her chances of being recognised as a refugee vary between 1% and 65%.
Political, social and economic instability, a lack of security and the political repression carried out by authoritarian regimes are the main factors behind migration and the migratory waves that spill over unceasingly into some countries in the Mediterranean basin, making them unable to manage the numerous difficulties caused by humanitarian emergencies.
For that matter, it is unacceptable that the European Parliament should speak of further increasing 'the transparency of the EU and the involvement of citizens in decision-making processes' when a majority rejected the holding of referendums in their own countries on the draft Treaty of Lisbon, precisely because they were afraid of the majority opinion of their people.
The report on public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) adopts the anti-labour decisions made by the Council and the Commission which are designed to strengthen the competitiveness of monopolies in order to safeguard the profits of capital and shift the burden of the deep capitalist crisis onto the workers' shoulders.
If the European Union is to further multilateral approaches to global challenges, its Member States must act coherently and consistently at the UN level, particularly in light of the forthcoming review conferences for the Millennium Development Goals and the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the review of the Human Rights Council's status and working methods.
In this respect I believe that the administrative, financial and legal constraints deriving from the agreement should not be excessive and therefore should not be such as to harm the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the healthcare sector, or else these enterprises could have serious difficulties in complying with the terms of the agreement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and when I say 'ladies and gentlemen', I include you, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, your team and the Council Presidency, because, at the end of the day, we experienced collegial cooperation, without which we would surely not have achieved the result that we did.
I must confess, Mr President, Commissioner, to a certain uneasiness, because, throughout this process we have always sought to reach an understanding but, nevertheless, there has been a certain amount of pressure for the report not to reach plenary and even now some comments suggest that Parliament's position will be disregarded as well.
Just as we worked in the Committee on Fisheries, chaired by Mrs Fraga Estévez, I hope that we can now carry on with this work within the committee and, on a wider scale, with the Council and the European Commission, so that we can make progress towards the work for the legislative proposals, which will be just as intensive.
Tighter controls on the airline carriers' financial situation, especially in the case of low-cost companies, a tighter control on mergers and takeovers, as well as setting up a sizeable guarantee fund, are a few of the solutions which could, in the long term, offer passengers protection in the event of airline bankruptcy.
Mr President, thanks to the law of unintended consequences, moving this week's votes to 6 May - that is the day of the general election in the United Kingdom - means that many, if not all, of the British MEPs from all parties and delegations will not be here on that day, which will also distort the final outcome.
Therefore, it is desirable to concentrate criminal proceedings that affect various jurisdictions in a single Member State, according to objective criteria and for the sake of the necessary transparency, not only to prevent time and resources being wasted, but also because of the costs involved and because it is essential to increase the consistency and efficiency of proceedings.
The action plan in the area of justice and home affairs is the first strategic initiative of the new Commission in order to put this work programme into practice; it follows very closely the mandates, as well as the broader philosophy, of the Stockholm Programme, and it takes into consideration the proposals and suggestions by Parliament and by the Council.
The insufficiency of the funds dedicated to cohesion and the incoherence of macro-economic policies that are obsessively focused on nominal convergence but make real convergence unviable are significant causes, which must be corrected by increasing the budgetary allocation to cohesion and by profoundly changing macro-economic policy.
Europe has huge untapped potential here that should be set against the fact that the construction of new nuclear power plants will make us dependent on them for many more decades to come - in other words new investments in nuclear energy are a means of postponing and preventing the expansion of renewable energy, a way of mortgaging the future.
In my opinion it is never too late and it would be remiss of this Parliament, this recently expanded Parliament, not to make a statement about the crimes of totalitarian Communism and not to initiate a discussion, because this is an experience that many people have brought to this place and indeed a majority of those in the debate were from the new Member States.
I should like to add the following to what has already been said: firstly, as the European Union is - and I trust that it will continue to be - one of the most important factors in terms of the defence of human rights, one of our priorities must be for us to speak internationally with one voice and, where possible, to avoid discord.
The former French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, has himself recently recognised the need to abandon sovereignty in some areas - something that is not easy for a Frenchman - and has spoken in favour of the national budgets of the euro area States being approved by the Eurogroup even before being submitted to the national parliaments.
Therefore, apart from military action which, in one form or another, would appear to be unavoidable in view of the passivity and helplessness of the local authorities, the international community, including the European Union - and here I appeal to Mrs Ashton - must, above all, be very active in the process of rebuilding state institutions.
The next item is the report by Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Community, the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007, of the International Labour Organisation (Convention 188) - C6-0218/2008 -.
Measures are also required to combat companies moving offshore, beginning with making public subsidies - particularly Community subsidies - conditional on meeting obligations such as the protection of jobs and local development, measures that impose a clear break with the neoliberal policies which are causing an economic and social disaster in the countries of the European Union before our very eyes.
In tough economic times like these, volunteering becomes all the more important and that is why I and others who brought this report forward are keen not only to raise awareness of the benefits of volunteering, but also to create a European Year where properly-funded initiatives will provide volunteering organisations the opportunity to encourage new volunteers to come forward.
I welcome the concern to decentralise and de-bureaucratise the CFP, and to regionalise fishery management within the limits set by the Treaty of Lisbon, and also the need to ensure that treatment is tailored to small-scale coastal fisheries and industrial fisheries, whilst respecting environmental, economic and social requirements.
I would like to ask the Council and Commission Representatives here whether they are prepared to take measures against those who violate human rights, in the manner indicated in Parliament's resolution of 16 December 2010, which called for an asset freeze and visa bans on those 60 officials implicated in the case of Mr Magnitsky, who unfortunately died in prison in Russia.
The June List and the Danish June Movement are keen for Amendments 138 and 166 to be included in the telecoms package and have therefore tabled a number of amendments which have been referred to as 'Citizens' Rights Amendments' by Internet activists and which have received the support of a couple of other political groups within the European Parliament.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much for these two reports - which we can evaluate as being for the new Parliament and, probably, for the current Commission still, as well as for the new Commission - on how we will negotiate, what tools we will have to manage the European budget and what kind of future European budget it will be.
Once again, what is really bothering the authors of this initiative is the fact that, despite all the problems, threats, dangers and interference, the Venezuelan people have been an example of the fact that it is worth fighting and that it is possible to build a fairer, more democratic and more peaceful country, and world.
Article 8e, paragraph 2, of Regulation (EC) No 863/2007establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 provides that 'any amendments to or adaptations of the operational plan shall require the agreement of both the Executive Director and the requesting Member State.'

(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans.
The European Union and the United States would do well to draw inspiration from the Cuban example rather than to feel complacent behind media performances that ill disguise their perception of aid as charity when, in fact, above all, it serves their own economic and political interests at the expense of sustainable reconstruction of the Haitian State and its economy.
We understand the Commission's reasons, but the waste crisis in Campania will not be solved by imposing financial penalties and nor will it be solved by suspending the payment of EUR 135 million in contributions for the period 2006-2013, plus a further EUR 10.5 million for the period 2000-2006, which was intended for the funding of waste-related projects.
There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits.
Moreover, some people are still advocating the fact that, to make progress with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership - which I would remind you is made up of three pillars: politics, economics, and society and culture - we simply need to brush aside the political difficulties in order to make headway with the economic and trade aspect.
The entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has strengthened EU policies and created new areas of competence - notably, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), competitiveness and innovation, space, tourism, the fight against climate change, social policy, energy policy, justice and internal affairs.
Madam President, I think it is important that we talk about good governance in the sense that it is, of course, important that we put pressure on all of us to bring in the reforms that are needed, but let us not forget that the main good governance we have in our own hands is to ensure that the European Union does what the European Union should do.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of my speech is to point out the severity of the deindustrialisation process affecting a range of Sicilian industrial centres, in particular, the Termini Imerese automotive centre owned by the FIAT group, and the Gela petrochemical centre belonging to the ENI group.
(NL) Mr President, with one minute to speak about a budget of EUR 141 billion, one must of course confine oneself to the essentials, namely that, at all levels - Community, national, regional and even lower - so-called 'European' money is really spent less efficiently and less carefully than money from closer to taxpayers.
That being the case, I believe that we should be able to reconcile matters and so conduct a campaign against terrorism, with respect shown, of course, for the great values and the great principles which mean that we in Europe attach much importance to the protection of privacy, on the one hand, and to the prevention of all commercial espionage, on the other.
I hope it will be clear that different forms of sexuality, of sexual orientation, of forms of living, have been part of all cultures and of all societies and are so in Lithuania, as well, and that hiding facts like that from the public, from young people, is simply a basis for inciting hatred, hate speech and hate crimes.
Given this intelligent political strategy, in my view, it is inappropriate to hold this urgent debate on two young bloggers sentenced following events for which proceedings are still ongoing while we overlook other situations that are truly tragic, such as the recent massacre of 57 people who had come together to support a presidential election candidate in the Philippines.
If one small accident, one small crack, for example, in the tank of an oil tanker, is not contained and confined, it may result, in the event of vibrations from rough seas or difficulties in decanting the cargo to another vessel, in a huge ecological disaster if there is no refuge where appropriate measures can be taken.
This proposal from the Commission amending Directive 98/8/EC on the placing of biocidal products on the market has become necessary after an evaluation of its implementation showed that the 10-year-period until 14 May 2010, foreseen for the evaluation of active substances used in biocidal products with the aim to include them in the Community positive list, will not be enough.
I am voting against the conclusion of this agreement as the retention of the requirement for a visa represents a certain check on unwanted immigration, whereas a lifting of the visa requirement for stays of up to three months would provide sufficient time for those who, in reality, plan to stay for a prolonged period to build up social networks.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, one year on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the position that the European Union adopts at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh is absolutely critical if we want to prevent a repeat of past events and want the dynamic of change to remain at the top of the agenda.
(NL) Mr President, in this report, I came across what is indeed a most bizarre example of why we absolutely must relax the rules in this way, namely that of a foreign student who has been granted a visa to study in Belgium and, as a result of the new arrangement, can now look up information in a Dutch library and then travel on to Barcelona.
However, we cannot agree on decisions that could end up putting at risk the production of these products in countries with more-fragile economies or by small and medium-sized enterprises that find it difficult to adapt, unless there is some sort of advance support, if only to defend the interests of European economic groups which, in fact, aim to dominate the market.
For that reason I am also grateful that the GSM 900 frequency band is also at the disposal of UMTS and that, for the first time, some thought has been given to the fourth generation network, which will hopefully receive the continued support of the Commission, so that we have comprehensive support for the provision of broadband, especially in rural areas.
(EL) Mr President, I too should like to comment on the question of natural gas, given that we have become witness over the last ten days to the conflict surrounding this issue, a conflict in which many of the Member States of the European Union who are dependent on natural gas for their energy have been caught up, causing problems for citizens, businesses and industry.
